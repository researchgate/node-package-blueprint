The `docs/` folder contains all the documentation necessary for this project.

## Documentation basics

Each folder holding a `README.md` file will preview when navigating folders within this **Github** repository on your browser.

The best way to document is to keep a coherent folder structure where each section/chapter has its own folder.

Each folder contains one file per topic regarding that folder level's documentation. This could be an example:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ docs
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ docs
        â””â”€â”€ documenting-on-github.md

```

## Host documentation on Github Pages

The documentation under `docs` and its sub-folders is accessible under [researchgate.github.io/node-package-blueprint/](https://researchgate.github.io/node-package-blueprint/) thanks to **Github Pages**.

There are different ways to configure the project to use Github pages.
