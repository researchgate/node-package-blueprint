# Documenting on Github

This project is set-up using the option *master branch /docs folder* for Github Pages.

[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is a static file generation powering Github Pages by default and it's used to host this project's `docs/` contents.

It works by parsing Markdown files and transforming them into HTML and this is how we can link from file to section, and viceversa.

As a starting point, autogenerated pages from Markdown's images, lists, and links should be sufficient. When this is not enough, you should create custom HTML pages to leverage the full power of the web. The best way is to generate pages using a static site generator tool. This will save you the effort of crafting a documentation website from scratch.

## Generating custom pages

For small or medium size projects we recommend these static generators:

* **[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)**: Interactive development & testing environment for React, React-Native, Vue UI components.
* **[Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)**: Blazing fast static site generator for React.

### Deploying Github Pages

#### Manual deployment:
* Deploying to Github Pages with **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook/)**.
* Deploying to Github Pages with **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploy-gatsby/#github-pages)**.

#### Continuous deployment:

Using a continuous integration service is a perfect way to have your latest version deployed to Github Pages automatically, after the checks have passed. On both **TravisCI** and **CircleCI** there is a way to achieve this.
